## Talking points: 

  - Explain what we are trying to make
  - Decide on market restrictions
  - Logistics for routine generation
  - How to deliver succinct, useful information in regards to training which isn't routine related
  
## Decisions made:

  - Initial 2 major branches in UX will be looks/performance. Allow user to choose whether they are beginner/intermediate/advanced athletes
  - Only major restriction is to avoid people with major restrictive injuries
  - Allow users to pick their primary and secondary goals out of the provided attributes. Each combination of attributes and level of lifter represents a different routine
  - Add FAQ section which addresses common fitness myths effectively, with associated studies
  - Routines will be dynamic, where users can pick a movement out of dropdowns per type of movement (eg pick between DB Rows/BB Rows for horizontal pull)
  - Add videos or instructions to perform movements correctly
  
## Tasks assigned:

  ### Yannick:
  
    - Rough UX map given current information
    - Start thinking about color palettes/branding
    - Bounce domain name ideas off the team
  ### Dawit:
  
    - Decide on actual attributes which routines will be built around. Reach out to Ibrahim for his ideas so far
    - Think about essential questions which will have to be answered in an FAQ (including nutrition/IIFYM)
    - Write ups on every attribute and what to expect when it is trained
    - How an athlete’s level of experience affects the routine being generated
  ### Travis:
  
    - Figure out hosting of website based on requirements (will the page be static? will there be back-end?)
    - Figure out ssl encryption and HTTPS
    - Figure out dev stack for the project (with Ibrahim)
    - Begin writing code which relates attribute priorities to different end products
