## Talking points: 

  - Addition of testing week to beginner routines
  - Dynamic excel generation
  - Travis' input on UX/UI trees
  - Initial development, rough working model
  - Possible ways to interface the thing
  
## Decisions made:

  - Beginner testing week will be extra sheet in excel deliverable
  - No need to do much option selection on webpage if possible to do in excel deliverable. All exercise selection and number inputs will be done by user on the excel deliverable
  - FAQ section will be very simple, short, informative. Eg Creatine? Helps with x. Test booster? Unhelpful. Etc
  - Axing advanced entirely
