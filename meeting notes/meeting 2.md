## Talking points: 

  - Fleshed out rough UX tree
  - Attributes to train
  - Days per week of training
  - Determining a user's level of proficiency
  - Possible ways to interface the thing
  
## Decisions made:

  - No longer a primary and secondary attribute; users pick 1 attribute to train for 3 month blocks
  - Users pick an attribute BEFORE a level of proficiency, meaning new UX trees. This is because a user may way to improve at pull-ups, but is already a proficient powerlifter. This makes them a beginner in the relevant training block.
  - Routines will be generated in the form of 3 month blocks where training is specified and can be exported to an excel sheet
  - Beginner/intermediate/advanced has obvious qualifiers (eg for bodyweight training we can use number of pullups as a metric)
  - Think about using a typeform with drop down menus as the interface
  - All beginner routines have an optional week of testing strength, so as to have a better informed routine

  
## Tasks assigned:

  ### Yannick:
  
    - Rethink UX trees now that the user picks between looks and performance, and then the attribute to work on, and THEN level of proficiency.
    - Lots and lots of rough ideas with UX/UI sketches, lo-fidelity and commitment, just to use as ideas. You can stop at layer 2; and leave the actual routine page for the next phase when you have sample programs and are ready for hi-fidelity mock ups. Upload them to the design folder, with relevant subdirectories.
    - Use the lists of attributes to structure the lo-fi mockups; located in the resources folder of the repo.

  ### Dawit:
  
    - Edit the files in the resource folder; adding descriptions/what to expect when the attribute improves 
    - Write rough FAQ question with all the BS questions you've had to answer as a PT, upload to resources folder
    - Provide 1-2 sample 12-week routines; upload them to the resources folder
    - Completely figure out the optional week of testing strength for beginner routines, and how you think it should be implemented

  ### Travis:
  
    - Still early, in a phase or two you'll get mockups to work with
